# Material

This library was born out of another project, where I decided to do some "material-y" stuff.

I then proceeded to make this little library: it's just fun, for a developer, to sometimes do some designing!

To use this library, clone this repo, move into the folder and run the comman `npm install`. At this point you can copy the files in the `lib` folder into your project. If you want to see a demo, run the command `npm start` to see a few examples of what elements look like.

Have fun!
